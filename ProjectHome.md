Hyper-War is a 2-player game designed to be like a competitive Missile Command.  The goal is to create a game with an interface that lends itself well to a cocktail-style arcade cabinet.  Eventually, the game will be installed in such a cabinet along with custom controls for each player.  If the end product turns out good enough, we may try to enter it in the 2010 Maker Faire in San Mateo, CA.
