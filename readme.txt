Welcome to HYPERWAR!

Deep in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way,
two opposing civilizations have been 
locked in a bitter war of attrition for
9,000 years.  The blue ocean planet
of Tantusiouswui and the green forest planet
of Varelyykesbri each believe that the other
is responsible for starting this horrific 
conflict.

Now, with the recent creation of the first
Interplanetary Nuclear Missile, YOU must 
be the one to end the war! Use your Nukes to wipe 
your opponent's homeworld clean of their filthy 
cities.  So begins....  HYPERWAR

HYPERWAR is an old-fashioned style space comabat game designed for a cocktail arcade cabinet.  It's design is influenced heavily by Missile Command, Asteroids, and Spacewar.

MODES
  Hyperwar features 4 modes of play.  From the attract screen, hit a number on the keyboard 1-4 to start a game corresponding to the mode you want to play.

Mode 1 - Hyperwar Command  (1 - 3 Players)

  Defend your homeworld from the incoming onslaught of nuclear missiles and death-beam-firing UFO's!  Become a Hero of Intergalactic Peace by blowing up your enemy's nukes and ships!  Up to 2 additional players may join the game  using fighter aircraft to assist.

For every 200 points, your military appropriations committee rewards you with a super weapon of your choice. (Middle mouse: Death Beam, Hold Middle Mouse: Singularity Launcher)

Mode 2 - Hyperwar Versus (2 Players)

  Conduct interstellar nuclear war with a friend!  This mode is designed for the controls and layout of the official Hyperwar cocktail arcade cabinet.  It won't work well in the PC version.  It is possible to make a future version that includes a config file to set up Hyperwar Versus mode for PC.

Mode 3 - Deep Space Encounter (2 Players)

  Blue and green spaceships happen upon each other deep in the cold void of space.  Having detected an enemy on their hyperradar, the blue and green planets each send a barrage of hyperwarp capable missiles into the area.  Avoid getting destroyed by enemy missiles while locked in single combat with the opposing ace pilot.

Each pilot has ten lives.

Mode 4 - Warzone Logistics Service CTF (2 Players)
  
  You are a humble delivery pilot and essential worker during the Great Hyperwar, a bitter war of attrition that has lasted 9000 years.  You must pick up goods from the opposing homeworld and add them to your stores back home. Standard Capture the Flag rules apply.
