# Introduction #

HyperWar is being designed to be placed into a cocktail-type arcade cabinet.  Thus, the interface should lend itself to that environment.  As a bonus, we will install MAME on the computer running this software.  The control inputs should be similar to the defaults for MAME.


# Cabinet #

So far, the cocktail cabinet we are looking at is a pre-cut wood cabinet that can be bought as a kit that you assemble at home.  The pre-cut control box won't be sufficient for our purposes.  We'll have to design and cut our own hole pattern for our controls.

# Controls #

We are planning using the X-Arcade "Build Your Own Arcade" board.  It is a board that has lots of pin headers for switches and other arcade controls.  It has PS2 and USB connections so Windows can see our custom designed controls as a regular USB game controller and/or keyboard.

# Computer and Monitor #

We will try to acquire a second-hand, slightly older computer and 19" CRT monitor

# Sound #

The cheapest way to go is probably to find an old 4-speaker boom box or receiver and rip it apart for installation into the game cabinet.  We'll try to get speakers with sizable woofers in order to provide a little force feedback in the game.
